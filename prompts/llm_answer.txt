Implemented LLM answerer and wired CLI to run against snapshots and fixtures. Now I’ll summarize the key questions and LLM outputs for sanity-checking.


New pieces added
Added LLM module to populate answers in FormSchema:
src/webbot/forms/answerer.py with generate_answers(schema, resume_text, job_context, ignore_optional=True, model="gpt-4o").
CLI commands:
answer-form-from-snapshot: extract from a snapshot, LLM-generate answers, print Q&A.
answer-realworld-fixtures: iterate tests/fixtures/realworld/*/{initial,after_apply}, LLM-generate answers, print Q&A.
How it uses existing components
Uses resume selection flow and OpenAI config; reuses resumes.json or falls back to concatenated resume.txt files for user_ben.
Answers are injected into FormField.meta["answer"], which executor.execute_fill_plan already expects.

Notes:
Some fixtures show duplicated Q&A entries because both initial and after_apply pages were extracted and printed; that’s expected for this sweep.
Optional fields were mostly skipped due to the --ignore-optional default; required and trivially-known fields were filled.
The Ashby “bullets” textarea is populated with concrete example achievements for sanity testing.
How to run locally
Answer a specific snapshot and print Q&A:
python -m src.webbot.cli answer-form-from-snapshot tests/fixtures/realworld/ashby-infisical-jd/after_apply --user-profile user_ben
Sweep all realworld fixtures:
python -m src.webbot.cli answer-realworld-fixtures --user-profile user_ben
To dry-run end-to-end on a live form and pause 60s for review, combine with execute-form-url:
Extract + answer via LLM is currently in snapshot commands; to live-fill, we’ll add a flag to execute-form-url that calls generate_answers instead of demo stubs. Say the word and I’ll wire that next.
If you want me to fetch additional DOM snapshots from the URLs in prompts/form_parser.txt, I can run the snapshot command against those URLs and then re-run the answerer over the new artifacts without submitting.
All tasks in the plan are complete, and answers are printed per fixture for sanity review.
