Hybrid Office Policy

We have a beautiful office in Liberty Village and work in a Hybrid schedule with Tuesdays, Thursdays and every other Friday as our in-office days. We provide lunch for our team every other Friday. 

We believe time together in person is valuable and important. We host ample social opportunities and encourage employees to attend team off-sites and events (dinners and game nights) as well as a yearly 4-day retreat.

Who we are: 

Curious: We lead with a genuine interest in customers, data, and the unknown. We work hard to understand other points of view, and ask great questions to investigate what is right.

Tough: Resilience is key in the unpredictable startup landscape. We embrace audacious goals, understanding that occasional setbacks serve as opportunities to refine our abilities.

Humble: We embody humility, eschewing arrogance and complacency while fostering an inclusive atmosphere for all. We remain open to change, recognizing that many of our existing practices may require improvement.

Analytical: We are data driven. Our commitment to data-driven decision-making ensures that we are precise, informed, and effective in our actions. We rely on data to guide our strategies and measure our success.

Ambitious: We aim for excellence with ambition, not arrogance. We nurture inclusivity and remain open to improving our practices on our journey to be our best.

How we work:

We Win Together: The greater good over function or self. No job is too big; no job is too small. We all may be called to serve in many different ways.

Customer Comes First: We are always optimizing the customer's experience, we put ourselves in the customer's shoes and always deliver nothing less than the best for our customers.

Bring The Sun: We believe in maintaining a positive attitude and spreading warmth and optimism. We assume good intentions and approach situations with a bright, hopeful outlook.

Bias For Action: We believe that moving fast is critical to success. By taking prompt and decisive action, we achieve our goals efficiently and effectively.

Think Big: We encourage innovative thinking and challenge the status quo. This means being open to new ideas, questioning existing processes, setting ambitious goals, and continuously seeking better ways to do things.

Grow Our Garden: Like a well-tended garden, our growth relies on nurturing ourselves and each other. We grow our garden by taking and giving knowledge, curiosity and continuous learning. Everyone has something to teach and something to learn. Be a mentor; be a student. Engage in the ongoing cultivation of knowledge.

Own It: We take pride in our work and strive for excellence. We take accountability, pay attention to details. We don't wait for problems to arise; we proactively identify and address potential issues.

If your experience aligns with this role you're looking for an exciting opportunity to join an early-stage startup, then we want to hear from you!
